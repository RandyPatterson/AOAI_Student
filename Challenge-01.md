# Challenge 01 - Azure OpenAI Fundamentals

## Introduction

The first step in understanding Azure OpenAI is to get familiar with the basics. In this challenge, you will learn about the core concepts of Azure OpenAI and how it can be used to build powerful AI infused applications. You will deploy a GPT-3.5 model and use the Azure Open AI Studio to interact with the model.

## Setup Azure OpenAI

1. Navigate to  [Azure Open AI Studio](https://oai.azure.com) and login with your Azure credentials
2. Deploy a ***Standard GPT3.5 Turbo*** model (version **0613** or greater) in a region that can host GPT-3.5, GPT-4o and DALL-E models

* Click `Clear Chat` and using the same email from the previous challenge, craft a prompt to rewrite the email and replace any PII with the string `[REDACTED: category]` where category is the PII category found in the email.

* Click `Clear Chat`and enter the following prompt into the Azure Open AI Studio and observe the results

    :exclamation:Before updating the prompt, clear the current chat history so the AI doesn't consider it's previous answers when responding to the new prompt.

    ```text
    A coin is heads up. Maybelle flips the coin over. Shalonda flips the coin over. Is the coin still heads up? 
    ```

    The answer, of course, should be ```Yes, the coin is heads up``` but the AI is likely to answer ```No``` because it does not always follow state changes correctly.  Rewrite the prompt convincing the AI to keep track of state changes to successfully answer the question with a ```Yes```.

## Success Criteria

1. Verify that you deployed a Standard GPT-3.5 model using Azure Open AI Studio
1. Verify that you can access the Azure Open AI Studio and create a new chat
1. Verify that you can craft a prompt to return a United States Postal Service formatted address from the provided email
1. Verify that you can craft a prompt to rewrite the email and replace any PII with the string `[REDACTED: category]`
